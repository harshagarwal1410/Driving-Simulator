# Driving-Simulator
Creating a real life driving simulator 
Developed a driving simulator that enhances the gaming experience by utilizing real-world values from steering and pedals. The simulator incorporates potentiometers to capture accurate input, which is then transmitted via Bluetooth using an ESP32 microcontroller. This enables seamless control of a racing game, creating an immersive and authentic driving experience.

Key Contributions:

•	Implemented potentiometers for precise sensing of steering wheel and pedal positions.__
•	Utilized ESP32 microcontroller to establish a Bluetooth connection between the simulator and the racing game.__
•	Integrated real-world input values into the gaming environment to accurately reflect user actions.__
•	Developed a user-friendly interface and controls for seamless interaction.__
•	Created a realistic driving environment to enhance immersion and enjoyment.__
•	Fine-tuned the simulator to ensure smooth and responsive gameplay.__


Outcome:

•	Enhanced the gaming experience by incorporating real-world input values for steering and pedals.__
•	Provided users with a more authentic and immersive driving simulation.__
•	Improved precision and responsiveness in controlling the racing game.__
•	Increased user engagement and enjoyment by seamlessly integrating physical input devices.__
•	Demonstrated the potential of bridging reality and virtual gaming for an enhanced user experience.__
